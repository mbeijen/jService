* set the environment using `export RAILS_ENV=production`
* set up the database:
  * specify your connection details in `config/environments/production.rb`
  * run postgres
  * `createuser -P -d steveo` (password `stepheno`)
  * `rails db:create`
  * `rails db:migrate`
  * `rake db:create`

* run `rake 'get_clues[1,38]'` -- NOTE: this will grab approx 200K clues and takes hours. The arguments here are the range of season you want to grab. You can save some time and grab selected seasons by doing something like `rake get_clues[20,31]`, which would only get seasons 20 through 31
